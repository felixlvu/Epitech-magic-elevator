# Elevator APP

The AUTOMATIC ELEVATOR project addresses a problem encountered in the Epitech building in Toulouse. Currently in our 3rd year at Epitech, our class is supposed to work on the 8th floor, but we cannot use the elevator because access requires a badge.

We found a temporary solution to bypass this issue: someone already on the 8th floor calls the elevator while we are on the ground floor, allowing us to go up. However, this solution is not sustainable in the long term as it depends on the availability of a person on the 8th floor willing to call the elevator for us.

Fortunately, we live in the 21st century, and technology can offer us a better solution. This is where our project comes in. The goal is to design a device that, upon receiving a command, automatically presses the elevator button on the 8th floor. To achieve this, we used a Raspberry Pi and a motor.

This GitHub repository presents the continuation of this solution. Through this site, you can press a button that sends a command to the Raspberry Pi, which then activates the motor to press the elevator button.

We decided to implement a login system on the site, without a registration option, so that we, as administrators, can control who is authorized to use the elevator.
